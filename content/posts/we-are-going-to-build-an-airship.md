So I promised my seven year old son that we will build an airship
drone. A real, flying airship, with helium and air pumps, motors and
rudders, which can be steered from distance and eventually be able to
find its way autonomously. A promise to a child is to be taken
seriuosly, so now there is no return: we are going to build an
airship!

Now, this is not an easy undertaking. There will be a lot to read up
on, and skills to develop: physics, construction, wireless
communication, control theory, sensor systems, route planning... My
son want this airship as a christmas present. I guess he will have to
wait a little longer.

At first, I will need to read up on airship contruction and the
relevant physics. We will need to think about the equipment: what
motors and servos should be used; which micro controller could be a
good fit for the task; what sensors are necessary. We need to decide
what materials should be used for the structure and for the
envelope. We need air pumps, gas and balloons. 

Hopefully we will have something flying with manual wireless control
of the motors, rudders and air pumps by summer 2019.
