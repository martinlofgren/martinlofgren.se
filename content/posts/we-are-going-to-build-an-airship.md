So I promised my seven year old son that we will build an airship
drone. A real, flying airship, with motors and rudders which can be
steered from distance and eventually 

There are three main categories of airships:

- Blimps
- Rigid
- Semi-rigid

Rigid airships are the kind which most of probable think of when
thinking of airships: the majestetic cigarr shaped vehicles of the
golden age of airships. Think Graf Zeppelin; think
[Hindenburg][1]. Rigid airships have a structure -- a skeleton --
which keep the shape of the envelope

Blimps are the most common kind after the catastroph in 1937. T
